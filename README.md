# chess
Javascript single-page crappy chess player. 

Can't overstate how poopily it plays-- it barely, barely can play chess. 
Sometimes, it seems to give up-- maybe it's doomscrolling somehow instead. 

Still: always wanted to make one: here it is. And, it's 1000 lines of JavaScript. 
And, it doesn't make you wait for it to move-- so, yeah, it's going to make mistakes. 

The board/pieces graphics are from old chess-problems books I found PDFs of somewhere. 
I like them a lot.
